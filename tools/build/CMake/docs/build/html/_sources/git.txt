Hacking Alt.Boost.CMake with Git
================================

Boost-cmake, in addition to using an alternative build system, uses
alternate version control.  This makes boost.cmake feasable: without
distributed version control it would be very difficult to maintain a
build system against upstream boost.

This document will review some common version-control procedures for
those who are unfamiliar with git.  More documentation is available at
`Hacking Boost via Git
<http://gitorious.org/boost/git-docs/blobs/raw/master/build/html/index.html>`_.
